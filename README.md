Intelligent Robotics

A robot capable of object recognition that will act as a waiter for the
people using study spaces.
The goal is to allow students sitting at a table to order drinks
from a web interface and be served, as well as having a
robot that wanders around checking for table occupancy and
detecting leftover bottles to be collected by cleaning staff. The
robot will pick up objects from a specified location by going
there and vocally asking which object it wants to take. It will
then bring the object to the specified table, and if more people
are sitting there it will ask to serve them too, using vocal
interaction. The robot will also return back to the served tables
after a while to ask the students for a refill of their drinks.
